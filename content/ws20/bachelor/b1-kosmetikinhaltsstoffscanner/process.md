{{<section title="First steps">}}
Our goal was clear. We generally knew what we had to do to reach our goal. Some questions still came up, that had to be answered first, before starting to code. 
We had to first decide on a framework we want to use. 
We chose Flutter because it fit our needs the best. 
It was also important to know upfront whether our app is offline or online.
After answering all these questions, we split up in two subgroups. One group was responsible for the backend and how we would retrieve the data. 
The other group was responsible for the frontend and how we integrate the text recognition plugin. 
We were always staying in contact and communicated with each other regularly.
We stayed in these subgroups up until our prototype was done.

{{<section title="Second phase">}}
Our second phase started with a brainstorm. 
We thought about possible features and sorted them in its priority.
This process took some time because we came up with great ideas but filtering them to what was possible in our given time window wasn't easy.  
The Miro board helped us a lot in the process of visualising and managing our ideas. 
We also used it as a Task/Kanban board. We never ran out of ideas, therefore our idea collection and prioritisation changed weekly.  
Staying in touch with our supervisor helped us a lot with our decision making over which features to implement.
Keeping a constant communication flow allowed us to be very flexible.
